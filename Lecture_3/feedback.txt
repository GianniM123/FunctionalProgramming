3.5 Quicktest:
Well done on the first two parts.

Runs and isqrt should be tested using the combinators:

When making runTest, the idea is to test runs with the combinators (?->). Thus you need some probes and a property to check the result with. The probes should be of type Probes [a]. We already made af function of that type: permutations. Our property is more tricky, it should check if every run is ordered: \r -> and (map ordered r). Thus the combinator becomes:

	(permutations [1..10] ?-> \r -> and (map ordered r))

isIntegerSqrt needs the same structure as runTest. Thus we first need probes, it should work for all numbers, but for times sake we will take the first thounds numbers: [0..1000]. The property is that the result is an integer square root of the input. Thus the imput x should fall between the input r squared and r+1 squared: \x r -> r*r < x && x < (r+1)*(r+1). Thus the combinator becomes:
	([0..1000] ?=> \x r -> r*r < x && x < (r+1)*(r+1))

Well done on the comb exercise.

3.32 Roman:
Very well done and good use of composition
