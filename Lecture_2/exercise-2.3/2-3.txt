2.3

    The Int is overflowing at certain points.

    The integer can be unlimited long. The int is limited at 2^63 âˆ’ 1 after this

    value the int will overflow. When the number gets to large the int will take

    a modulo of 2^64 and save the module as the value. After 66! the modulo of

    the value is always 0, this means the Int will always be 0.
